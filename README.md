## Features

MiniReviews is a website that enables users to post their own film reviews. Reviews are intended to be short and sweet, like Twitter.

### Existing Features

- Backend

![Entity relationship diagram](/readme_assets/erd.png)

  - Database

    - The backend connects to a database of movies and reviews. Records can be added or retrieved through several API endpoints useing the Django rest framework. 

![API endpoints](/readme_assets/APIendpoints.jpg)

  - API endpoints

    - The diagram above shows some of the API endpoints concerning the bulk of the content; genres, movies and reviews. There are also endpoints for likes and follows.
    - 

- Frontend

  - Nav bar
    - The NavBar is a reusable component that appears on every page.
    - It includes links to all parts of the website, allowing users to easily navigate between them. It uses CurrentUserContext to determine if the user is logged in or not changes accordingly. If a user is not logged in, it will render links to home, movies, sign in & sign up. If a user is logged in it will render links to home, movies, feed, popular, liked, sign out and profile. The nav bar collapses to a dropdown menu to save space on smaller devices.

![Home page](/readme_assets/homepageloggedout.jpg)

  - Reviews page

    - The reviews page list recent reviews. The feed, liked and popular pages are all variants of this page. The feed page shows only content by profiles that the user has followed. The liked page only shows reviews that the user has liked. The popular page shows all reviews ordered by nmber of likes.

![Home page](/readme_assets/revewdetailwithcomments.jpg)

  - Review detail

    - Each review comprises some short text and a rating out of 5 stars (with 0 being the lowest option). Each review also has a tally of how many likes and comments it has. Comments are listed below the review.

    - The reusable Review component is used to list reviews on the reviews page and on the detail page. It uses the review records passed to it as props to display the information.

![movies page](/readme_assets/moviespageloggedin.jpg)

  - Movies page

    - All movies are listed on the movies page. The user is able to use the search bar to find specific movies. Movie title, director and genre are all searchable.

  - Movie detail
    
    - Each movie has an image of a poster, along with information such as the title, release date, director, genre & actors. Genres are displayed as colour-coded badges.
    - There is a link to a reviews page with only reviews of that partiular movie. There is also a link for the user to write their own review.
    - The Movie component is used to display movie information. Similar to the review component it takes review information as props.
    - The GenrePicker component is used to display the genres associated with the movie entry. It uses the genre ids passed as props and makes a request to the genres API endpoint to get the name and colour of each genre and also maps over the list of genres associated with the movie. For each one it passes name and colour as props to a GenreButton component wich renders the genre badge.

  - Profile

    - The profile page shows statistics such as number of reviews written, followers and how many other users they are following. There is also a small bio section and all reviews by the user are listed below. The user can edit their own profile from this page.

![profile page](/readme_assets/profilepage.jpg)

  - Review form

    - The review form page includes an image of the movie, a field for the user to write their review and a bit where users can rate the movie out of 5.

![sign in page](/readme_assets/signin.jpg)

  - Sign in/Sign up pages

    - Allows users to sign in or out of the website, and also to sign up for an account.

![sign in page](/readme_assets/notfound.jpg)

  - Page not found page
    - If a user enters an URL that is not recognised, the user will be informed.

  - Favicon
    - The website has a custom favicon to distinguish it from other websites

### Features to implement

- A form for users to add movies to the database, allowing the user to upload an image and choose from a list of genres

- A way for users to like movies similar to how they can with reviews

- A 'favourite movies' section on the profile page

- A way for users to like comments similar to how they can with reviews

## Deployment

The frontend and backend of this project have been combined into one repository, and therefore one heroku app. The following steps were taken to deploy this project to Heroku:

1. Create new app in Heroku, selecting Europe as the region

2. In Settings, config vars, add the config vars CLOUDINARY_URL, DATABASE_URL, DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, ALLOWED_HOST, CLIENT_ORIGIN and SECRET_KEY, ensuring that ALLOWED_HOST and CLIENT_ORIGIN are the URL of the hosted heroku site.

3. In the Deploy section, go to deployment method, select GitHub, search for the repository and click connect.

4. Scroll down to Manual Deploy, ensure the main branch is selected and click Deploy Branch
